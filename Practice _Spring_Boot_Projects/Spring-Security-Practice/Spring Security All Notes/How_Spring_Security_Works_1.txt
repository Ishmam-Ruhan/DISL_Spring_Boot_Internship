				#_____Very Basics of Spring Security_________


	+ When we hit a request first it comes to dispatcher servelet. Then, dispatcher servelet send request to respective controller to 

	  perform action.

	+ If we want to execute something before servelet, we need to add filters. So, We are going to add security 

	  before dispatcher servelet, so that every request should be authenticated.

	
	# Spring Security:

	 + Spring security mainly implemented by 'Filters'. A Filter Chain is combination of multiple filters. For Ex:

		Ex: One filter takes care authentication

		    One filter takes care authorization

		    One filter takes care log-out

		    One filter takes care remember-me

		
		   And So on.....



	+ Instead of configuring all these filters, we have to configure DFP(Deligating Filter Proxy). We have to configure it. Whenever

	  a request come to the application, our DFP will filter the request.

	+ DFP will deligate the request to FCP(Filter Chain Proxy). And Filter Chain Proxy is deligate of Above mentioned filters/ Filter Chains.

	+  Our system can have multiple Filter Chains. One chain for Login via Google / One for Facebook / One for Github .. So On

		- We have to mapping request for different different Filter Chains.

			Ex: /google/*	-> Will execute google filer-chain

			   /facebook/*  -> Will execute facebook filter-chain

			  /credential/*  -> will execute our custom email password filter-chain

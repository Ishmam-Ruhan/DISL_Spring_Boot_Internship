					#------------- User Trying to Access Secured Resource(With Credentials) -------#

	

	_/ 1st Filter: 
			Name: Security Context Persistance Filter

			Responsibility: 
				
				- Is there any security context in the session? No! So, It creates a empty Security Context and Populated 
				  "Security context holder."

				- Means, Is it a logged in user/device/application? NO

	X  2nd Filter:

			Name: Logout Filter

			Responsibility: 

				- Is this a logout request? NO! So, It is not invoked.

	_/  3rd Filter:

			Name: Authentication FIlter

			Responsibility: 

				- Is it a authentication request? or Is user send any credintial through this request? YES

				- So it will deligate "Authentication Manager" to authenticate it.
				   
				   + Authentication Manager:

					- Authentication Manager is an interface.

					- It has one method called "authentication" which takes parameter of object "Authentication"

				   + Authentication:

					- It is an interface.

					- It has few methods like: getDetails(), getPrincipals(), getAuthorities(), isAuthenticate(),
					                    setAuthenticate()

				- Authentication Manager actually doesn't perform this operation. It delegates a method called

				  "Authentication Provider"

					+ Authentication Provider:

						- Several authentication providers are:

							1. DaoAuthenticationProvider

							2. OpenIdAuthenticationProvider

							3. LdapAuthenticationProvider

					+ It actually perform the Authentication.

					+ Authentication Provider has to know the original details of the user.

					+ So, It deligates "UserDetailsService"

					+ "UserDetailsService" deligates to our custom "User Details" class which implements "User Details"
					   interface

				- Authentication Manager uses this "User Details" to create authentication.(See in picture)

				- After successfully authentication, 

						- It creates "Security Context" with Authentication(Principals & Authorities)

						- It also kept in "Thread Local", So that in this current thread we can retrive security
					          context from everywhere

						- Security Context also saved in session as well



	X  4th Filter:

			Name: Remember me filter

			Responsibility: 

				- It checks in the request is there any COOCKIE in the request called "Remember Me"? NO
				

	X  5th Filter:

			Name: Exception Translation Filter

			Responsibility:

				- Check is there any exception or NOT! Exception means not authorised or not authenticated.
				
				- If not authenticated, it redirects to login page.

				- When Top to Bottom it occurs no error/exception.

				- After getting exception in 6th filter, then this filter starts executing;

					- It will deligate "Authentication Entrypoint"

					- It will then redirect to "login" url

	_/  6th Filter:

			Name: Filter Security Interceptor

			Responsibility:

				- Check is there any security on the resource? YES. But the user is not logged in. So, it threw an 
				  Authentication Exception The exception will be invoked by "Exceptation Translation FIlter".

	

	** After that it rolled back to top step by step and invoked the 1st filter again. Again it checks if the security context changed 
	  or not. If it is not changed then it will remove the "Security Context Holder"

					#----------- How SSL works -----------#

	1. Assume, "A" is Server and "B" is Browser-Client.

	2. First, for server "A", We should mentiion, where is our key in properties file.

	

	-> When client "B", sends a request via Https to server, Server-A responds with its certificate.

	# What Browser-Client-B do after receving the certificate..??

	-> Browser-B  will take the "Public Key" from certificate.

	-> Browser-B will also geneate a random session key.

	   After that, Browser-B will encrypt the session-key using the "Public Key" received from certificate.
	
           and WHO CAN DECRYPT IT..????

	   as we know from SSL, if anything is encrypted with Public Key, can be Decrypt with Private key and vice-versa


	-> Finally, "Browser-B" sends the encrpted data to the "Server-A"


	3. Server-B can extract/get the session-key by decrypt it with private key.


	## Now, When server sends data in encrypted format(using the session key + Private key) to Browser-----
													      |-----> Symmetric Encryption
	## Again, Browser sends data in encrypted format (using session key + Public key) to Client------------
	
	So, For data transportation, symmetric encryption is used.

	----------------------

	# SSL Handshaking:

	-> Initially, some requests exchanged between Client-B and Server-A. It is known as SSL Handshake.

	-> During this, Server & Client exchange certificate, agree upon this random session key.

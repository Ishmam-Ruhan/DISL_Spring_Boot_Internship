	1. Stands for:     Http + SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)

	2. It gives Transport Layer Security.

	   *** We can use Basic Authentication if Https is enabled. Otherwise we should go for Digest Authentication ***

	
	
						#---------- How SSL works? -------------#


	1. We have two application. Each application has two type of keys:

			- Private key

			- Public key (Stored in certificate section of .jks file. ".jks" file we can generate it in java.)


	2. Asymetric Encription happens here. In asymetric encription -

		# If data is encripted with "Private key", then it can be decrypt with "Public Key".

		And Vice-versa,-

		# If data is encripted with "Public key", then it can be decrypt with "Private Key"

		      
	3. ".jks" file has multiple entries. Each entry has a unique Alias.


	4. One of the entry is Private Key.

	5. Another one is Certificate. Certificate contains User Details and Public Key.
